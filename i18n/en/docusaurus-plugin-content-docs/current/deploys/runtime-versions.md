# Node.js and Python versions

Layero picks the version to build and run your project on. If you need a
specific one, you can pin it.

## Supported versions

| Node.js | Status |
|---|---|
| 24 | supported |
| 22 | supported, **default** |
| 20 | supported |
| 18 | deprecated |

| Python | Status |
|---|---|
| 3.13 | supported |
| 3.12 | supported, **default** |
| 3.11 | supported |
| 3.10 | supported |

The version your project built on — and where it came from — appears in the
build log as `[config] node=22.18.0 (.nvmrc)`.

## Pinning a Node.js version

Listed in priority order; the first one found wins.

**1. Project settings** — **Project → Settings → Node version** (you can also
pick it while creating the project).

**2. `.nvmrc` in the repository root**

```
22
```

**3. `.node-version`** — same format.

**4. `engines.node` in `package.json`**

```json
{
  "engines": { "node": ">=22" }
}
```

The dashboard setting takes priority over repository files: it is the last place
where you tell the platform what you want, and that choice should not lose
silently to a file. If the version is set in both places we build on the one you
picked, and name the pin we overrode in the build log:

```
[config] node=24 (project settings); project setting overrode .nvmrc=22
```

Leave the setting on "Auto" if you want the repository to decide.

A major (`22`) is enough. We update the exact build within a major ourselves,
along with security updates.

## Pinning a Python version

**1. `runtime.txt`** (Heroku format):

```
python-3.12
```

**2. `.python-version`** — just `3.12`.

There is no dashboard setting for Python yet.

## If you pin an unsupported version

The build does not fail. We build on the default version and say so in the log:

```
[config] WARNING: Requested Node.js 16 is not supported (supported: 18, 20, 22, 24). Using 22.18.0.
```

This way a typo in `.nvmrc` does not block a deploy. Do read the warning
though: the default may differ from what you build on locally.

## Retiring versions

When a version reaches end of life upstream, we go through three steps:

1. **Warning** — in the build log and in the dashboard. Everything keeps working.
2. **Closed for new builds** — roughly 3–4 months later. A new deploy on that
   version will not start, and the error says what to change.
3. **Anything already deployed keeps running, always.** We never rebuild your
   site without you: static files sit in storage, application images are
   immutable.

We email you before a version closes.

**Node.js 18** is at step one. New builds on it close on **1 September 2026**.

:::tip[Worth upgrading early]
Node.js 18 genuinely cannot build a modern frontend any more — Vite, for
instance, fails with `ReferenceError: CustomEvent is not defined`, a function
added in Node 19. If your project is pinned to 18, moving to 22 usually needs
no code changes.
